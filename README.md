### Hello there! :wave: I'm Victoria.

But my friends call me Vic.

:round_pushpin: South Carolina
:mortar_board: Bachelor of Arts in Mass Communications

### Currently: :telescope:
Iâ€™m finishing up [Georgia Tech's Full Stack Web Development Certification](https://pe.gatech.edu/courses/georgia-tech-coding-boot-camp) program :honeybee:.
In the current section, we are covering `MERN` stack while diving deeper into `React` and `GraphQL`.
- My last project, [LaborHub](https://github.com/jsnicholas/LaborHub), includes `MySQL`, `mongoose` and `Handlebars.js`.
- My current deployed [portfolio](https://victoriamcn.github.io/Portfolio/) was created with `HTML` and `CSS`.
- :hammer: ***However, a more dynamic [porfolio](https://github.com/victoriamcn/React-Portfolio/tree/main) is under construction.***
