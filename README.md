### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Victoria.

*You may call me Vic if you like.*

## Currently ðŸ”­
Iâ€™m enrolled in Georgia Tech's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Learn more about it [here](https://pe.gatech.edu/courses/georgia-tech-coding-boot-camp). In the current section, we are covering `MERN` stack while diving deeper into `React` and `GraphQL`.
- My last project, [LaborHub](https://github.com/jsnicholas/LaborHub), implemented `MongoDB`, `mongoose` and `Handlebars.js`.
- My current deployed [portfolio](https://victoriamcn.github.io/Portfolio/) was created with `HTML` and `CSS`.
- ***However, a more dynamic [porfolio](https://github.com/victoriamcn/React-Portfolio/tree/main) is under construction.***
