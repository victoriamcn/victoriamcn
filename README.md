### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Victoria.
**You may call me Vic if you like.**

## Currently ðŸ”­
Iâ€™m enrolled in Georgia Tech's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Learn more about it [here](https://pe.gatech.edu/courses/georgia-tech-coding-boot-camp). In the last section, we covered node.js, Express.js, SQL, authentication with bcrypt, and handlebars.js. We also implemented Object-Oriented Programming, Object-Oriented Mapping, and Model-View-Controller paradigms in our code. See my current project: [here](https://github.com/jsnicholas/LaborHub)
